The network maintenance that was scheduled for tonight has been canceled. IT is working with the vendor to reschedule the maintenance. {{< track "2023-01-11 14:52:00" >}}


The Division of Information Technology will perform network maintenance between 5:30 p.m. and midnight on Wednesday, Jan. 11. During the maintenance, periodic disruptions will occur on the K-State networks, and individuals on campus may have trouble accessing the internet during the maintenance.
