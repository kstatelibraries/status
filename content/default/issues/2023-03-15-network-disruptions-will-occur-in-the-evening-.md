{{< track "2023-03-15 09:02:00" >}} -- The Start Time has Changed to 6PM this evening.

The evening of March 15th Campus IT will be performing maintenance to the campus network starting at 6:00PM. Hale Library will have brief outages during the maintenance periord while intenret traffic is routed over the different pathways on campus.

> During the work, if basic functionality (Internet connectivity, routing, GlobalProtect, VPN, or building connectivity does not work, the issues will be worked on to try to find a resolution. If we run into unforeseen issues where this functionality is not performing correctly and doesnâ€™t appear that it will be in a timely manner, we will reach a point where we roll back to the original hardware. If problems can be resolved quickly enough, we will reschedule for March 16th for the same 6:00pm to 6am March 17th.
