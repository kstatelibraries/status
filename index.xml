StaffNet is available again, and can be accessed without utilizing the VPN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Update 6/3/2022 at 1:16PM
StaffNet will be unavailable today 6/3/2022 from 2PM-2:30PM so an Emergency Patch can be applied.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to an unpatched critical vulnerability in the software that runs StaffNet, we have restricted access to campus. If you need to access StaffNet from off-campus you will need to utilize the &lt;a href="https://www.k-state.edu/it/security/secure-data/vpn/index.html">VPN&lt;/a>. Once a patched version is released, we will schedule maintenance to apply the fix, and relax the restrictions at that point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[Resolved] Website Outage</title><link>https://status.its.lib.k-state.edu/issues/2022-06-08-website-outage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://status.its.lib.k-state.edu/issues/2022-06-08-website-outage/</guid><category>2022-06-08 18:40:00</category><description>&lt;p>The library website will be unavailable for a short period of time today at 5:30 PM Wed Jun 8th so that we can roll back a patch from this morning which affected some auxillary services for staff and the public.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[Resolved] Scheduled ILLiad Maintenance</title><link>https://status.its.lib.k-state.edu/issues/2022-05-07-oclc-illiad-planned-maintenance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 23:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://status.its.lib.k-state.edu/issues/2022-05-07-oclc-illiad-planned-maintenance/</guid><category>2022-05-08 03:05:00</category><description>&lt;blockquote>
