StaffNet will be unavailable today 6/3/2022 from 2PM-2:30PM so an Emergency Patch can be applied.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Due to an unpatched critical vulnerability in the software that runs StaffNet, we have restricted access to campus. If you need to access StaffNet from off-campus you will need to utilize the &lt;a href="https://www.k-state.edu/it/security/secure-data/vpn/index.html">VPN&lt;/a>. Once a patched version is released, we will schedule maintenance to apply the fix, and relax the restrictions at that point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[Resolved] Scheduled ILLiad Maintenance</title><link>https://status.its.lib.k-state.edu/issues/2022-05-07-oclc-illiad-planned-maintenance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 23:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://status.its.lib.k-state.edu/issues/2022-05-07-oclc-illiad-planned-maintenance/</guid><category>2022-05-08 03:05:00</category><description>&lt;blockquote>
